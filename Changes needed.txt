And also, you have to change the auth_backend value in airflow.cfg:
	
	auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth
	
	deny_all will probably never let us log in
	
And also also, in docker_compose.yaml:
	AIRFLOW__API__AUTH_BACKENDS: "airflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth,airflow.api.auth.backend.session"
	
	There is a typo on that line ("basic_authm"), which will never let us run the auth package.
	
	Thank Copilot for help, took me a while still to find those things. Not My Repo.
	

And now after running docker compose down and docker compose up init-airflow and docker compose up, I have the login screen


Why the repo has issues, is beyond me but I am not probably able to update the repo (I could try, but I don't want to).



Also, the maintainer of the repo should actually update his code to match updates. We have a ton of depracation warnings and issues that come from that

I know how difficult it is to keep everything up-to-date, I'm doing the same at my work, but it should be done, so we won't study "dinosaurs".
